## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I was able to really consolidate and use my knowledge of CSS Custom Properties to create dark and light modes. Also used the :has pseudoselector to check if radio buttons had been checked.
